=head1 NAME

DB::Transaction - feather-weight transaction management for your DBI handles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DB::Transaction qw(run_in_transaction);

    my $dbh = My::Application->get_dbh;

    run_in_transaction {
        $dbh->do('
            update risky_business -- in some fashion
        ');
    } db_handle => $dbh, on_error => 'rollback';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DB::Transaction provides one function: run_in_transaction

=head1 EXPORTS

By default, none. On request, C<run_in_transaction>.

=head2 run_in_transaction BLOCK db_handle => $db_handle, on_error => ['rollback' | 'continue']

Begin a transaction on $db_handle, then run BLOCK. Any errors raised in the
course of executing BLOCK will cause the current transaction to be handled
according to your C<on_error> specification.

C<on_error> may be one of these two options:

=over 4

=item * rollback -- call this dbh's ->rollback method

=item * continue -- just keep on chugging, man!

=back

C<on_error =E<gt> 'rollback'> is the default behavior.

Transactions may be nested, though your underlying database may not support
nested transactions. It's up to you to know whether this is supported or not.
